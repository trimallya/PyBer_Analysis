# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
This challenge analyzes rideshare data to compare the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and fares for each city type (urban, suburban, and rural). These variances in total fares for each city type for the first 4 months of the year 2019 can be seen in the visualization created at the end.

## Results
### 01/2019-04/2019 Total Fares
It can be noted when looking at the graph for the total fares of each city type for 01/2019-04/2019 (seen below) that the urban fares are consistently higher than the suburban fares, which are consistently higher than the rural fares. This means that urban cities produce the most amount of money with the PyBer rideshare app, while rural cities produce the least.

One interesting observation is that all three cities experience a spike towards the end of February at around the same time. It would be interesting to further research why this sudden spike occurs, and possibly implement similar methods to other months in the year. 

### Total PyBer Summary Statistics
After taking a closer look at the breakdown of each city type, it can be seen that rural cities have 5 and 13 times less the number of total rides than the suburban and urban cities, respectively. However, the average fare per ride in rural cities is greater than that of both urban and suburban cities. 
In addition, rural cities have about 6 and 30 times less the number of total drivers than suburban and urban cities, respectively. However, in accordance with the higher average fare per ride, drivers in rural cities make about 1.5 and 3 times more per ride than the drivers in suburban and urban cities, respectively. 
These comparisons can be seen in the chart below.

### What This  Means
These comparisons show that although drivers in rural areas are not able to complete as many rides as those in suburban or urban cities, they receive more money for each ride completed. However, it is important to note that despite these differences, rural cities still remain at the lowest level of total fare output. 

## Summary 
One possible solution to address such disparities is providing more drivers for the rural cities. This would increase the total number of rides being completed, which would in turn also increase the total fares. As rural and suburban cities experience greater fare prices, it is possible that individuals who live in such locations are unable to use the rideshare service due to an inability to spend that amount for each ride they take. One potential solution could be to provide users with a discounted price for a certain amount of time in order to encourage them to try the app out. Once they have used the service and noticed its many benefits, the chances of them continuing to request rides may increase, as well. In addition, the amount of people in rural cities is far less than that of urban cities. This means that it is essential to be one of the few main, if not the main, rideshare services in the area. In order to ensure more people in these areas sign up, a possible solution could be incorporating features that allow users to get a discount for every friend who signs up through their recommendation. This would further encourage individuals living in less populated locations to use the app more frequently.
